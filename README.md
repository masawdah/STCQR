<h3 align="center">Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning-Based Soil Moisture Forecasting Using Conformal Prediction</h3>

<p>
    This repository contains the code used in the paper: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning-Based Soil Moisture Forecasting Using Conformal Prediction. 
    The code implements conformal prediction with spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal localization to quantify uncertainty in soil moisture forecasting under exchangeability violations.
