<h3 align="center">Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning-Based Soil Moisture Forecasting Using Conformal Prediction</h3>

<p align="center">
    This repo repository contains the code for uncertainty quantifcation using conformal prediction for soil moisture forecasting. The code implements conformal prediction with spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal localization to quantify uncertainty in soil moisture forecasting under exchangeability violations.
